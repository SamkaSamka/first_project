# first_project
Second testrun of first project
I have built this website based on this template: 
https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png
I had to create this website, based on this picture. So the code is written by me. 
Especially the CSS needs some clean-up, but I am happy with this result as a first try. 

I think I have worked on it for about 10-12 hours in total.
